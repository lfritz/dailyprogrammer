# [2015-06-17] Challenge #219 [Hard] The Cave of Prosperity

Solutions for [Challenge #219](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3aewlg) in Rust. After playing around with different approaches, I ended up with four different solutions:

 * `cave-1.rs`: naive solution.
 * `cave-2.rs`: dynamic programming solution. Wikipedia has an [explanation of the algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem#Pseudo-polynomial_time_dynamic_programming_solution).
 * `cave-3.rs`: meet-in-the-middle algorithm. See [explanation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#Meet-in-the-middle).
 * `cave-4.rs`: meet-in-the-middle algorithm using binary search.
